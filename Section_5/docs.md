# Section 5 - Mastering Typed Arrays
- __Typed Arrays__: Arrays where each element is some consistent type of value.
- Typescript can do type inference when extracting values from an array.
- Typescript prevent us from adding incompatible values to the array.
- We can get help with 'map', 'forEach', 'reduce' functions.
- Flexible - arrays can still contain multiple difference types.
- Using typed array when we need to represent a collection of records with some arbitrary sort order.
